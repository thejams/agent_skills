# 🧠 Agent Skills Repository

A curated collection of **reusable agent skills** designed to be plugged into modern AI-assisted development environments such as **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Antigravity**, and similar tools.

This repository acts as a **skill library**: each skill is self-contained, documented, and ready to be copied into your project.

## ✨ What are Agent Skills?

**Agent skills** are structured capability definitions that describe *what an AI agent can do*, *how it should behave*, and *how it should reason* when performing a specific task.

They can include:
- Problem-solving strategies
- Coding conventions
- Architectural decision rules
- Review and analysis workflows
- Domain-specific reasoning patterns

Each skill is documented in a human- and AI-readable format to ensure consistent behavior across tools and projects.
